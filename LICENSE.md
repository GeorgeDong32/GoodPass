    Liability and Warranty
</h2>

```
       Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       
       basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  
       statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       
       Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        
       particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     
       quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        
       Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     
       (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   
       repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   
       essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   
       authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.       
```

```
       Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort       
       (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any            
       Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as           
       permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,          
       special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character       
       including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of     
       goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any     
       and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party       
       shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This    
       limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or    
       personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the        
       extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some                
       jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of            
       incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and           
       limitation may not apply to You.
