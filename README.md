## 📈Development Plan
🚧 GPHES(GoodPass Hash Encryption System) and GPSES(GoodPass Symmetrical Encryption System). Both are TEA(Twice Encryption Algorithm) that protect your password efficient and safely.

🏗️ Graphic interface based on QT is under development. Maybe come out in July in the version v3.0.0.
