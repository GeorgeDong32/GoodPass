### This branch is set up to store some backup files of GoodPass Project. Most of the files are unfinished or unrepaired, so don't use them as the release files.

### The released application is in the "release" part, just go and download it to use. Or visit [Releases](https://github.com/GeorgeDong32/GoodPass/releases) to download.

> *For security reasons, some files are only backed up locally*
